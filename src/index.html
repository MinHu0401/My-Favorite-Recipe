					<p>For my first official Stardew Valley recipe I knew I wanted to make something really special. Although
						the recipe I finally put together is relatively simple, the process was anything but. The number of
						recipe fails I experienced during the development of this one has GOT to be a new record for me! That
						said, I didn't quit until I had something really delicious and I'm so proud to share the recipe with
						you
						all now :].</p>

					<p class="citation"><em>Farming might not seem like a fun premise for a game at first, but I dare you not
							to
							get sucked in once you start playing.</em></p>

					<p>So what's the big deal with Stardew Valley and why did I sacrifice so many pumpkins to this recipe? I
						think the game can best be explained as a love letter to the 'farm simulation' genre of video games
						and
						more specifically to the Harvest Moon series. Stardew Valley sees the player take on the task of
						rehabilitating a derelict farm. You will generally go about this by doing things like clearing
						farmland,
						tilling soil, planting vegetable seeds, and caring for the plants until they can be harvested and sold
						for money. The player can then take this money to reinvest in the farm by buying new tools and seeds
						among other things.</p>

					<p>There's wayyy more to do in this game than just farming however! You can fish, you can mine,
						participate
						in town festivals, raise animals, fight a capitalist empire, and if you play your cards right, you can
						even marry one of the eligible townspeople and start a family! I love these types of games and I am
						very
						much looking forward to starting a new farm on my Nintendo Switch.</p>

					<p class="citation"><em>It's so bountiful!</em></p>

					<p>As you can imagine with a game about growing crops, there's a good deal of cooking found in it, 72
						recipes in fact! (And that's not even mentioning things like wine, jam, and cheese that you can
						process.)
						With the onset of the cooler weather I thought it would be appropriate to try making a dish that
						highlighted some fall flavors and I don't think I could've asked for anything more suitable than
						today's
						recipe: Autumn's Bounty.</p>

					<h3>WALKTHROUGH</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>If you've never cooked with an actual pumpkin before, now's the perfect time to learn! (although
								I
								suppose we have used it before.) Start by peeling the skin off either with a vegetable peeler,
								or
								what I find much easier, just a sharp knife; it's kind of like peeling a melon. Use a sharp
								knife
								to cut off the top and bottom of the pumpkin and then cutting it into quarters. Remove the seeds
								with a spoon or small knife and reserve them if you feel like making pumpkin seeds, if not,
								simply
								discard them.</p>
							<img src="images/step2.jpg" alt="Peeling and cutting the pumpkin">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Cut up the pumpkin into medium dice as shown here. Peel and chop the sweet potato similarly and
								toss the vegetables in a mixing bowl along with the oil, honey, salt, pepper, and thyme sprigs.
								Spread the mixture on an un-greased baking sheet and place in the oven for 20 - 25 minutes. Pop
								the
								oven open about every 5 minutes during this cook time to give the pan a stir and avoid any
								burning.
								Once the veggies are soft and begin to color, remove the pan from the oven and set it aside (oh,
								and remove those thyme sprigs!)</p>
							<img src="images/step3.jpg" alt="Roasting pumpkin and sweet potatoes in the oven">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Next it's time to make your kitchen smell amazing. Slice the three strips of bacon into small
								strips and throw them in a fry pan over medium heat to render. While the bacon is cooking, chop
								up
								your red onion and garlic and add them to the pan once there's a good amount of fat present,
								about
								two minutes.</p>
							<img src="images/step4.jpg" alt="Cooking bacon, onion, and garlic in a pan">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>While the onions and garlic cook you can prepare the brussel spouts (notice a pattern here?)
								Because they're so dense, I mainly used the outer leaves in this dish. The easiest way to get at
								them is to trim the base and remove them from the bottom up as they fall away from the center.
								You
								can also slice the sprouts thinly if that's more your speed. Once the onions have softened up a
								bit, throw in the brussels and toss to combine.</p>
							<img src="images/step5.jpg" alt="Preparing Brussels sprouts and adding them to the pan">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Cook the brussels with the rest of the ingredients for a minute or two before finally adding the
								roasted pumpkin and sweet potato back in to the pan. Chop up a red skinned apple (I used gala)
								and
								add it to the pan at this time as well. Toss everything in the pan for two more minutes over
								medium
								heat until everything is heated through and combined. Serve 'the Autumns Bounty' right from the
								pan
								or empty into a casserole dish for a shareable side dish!</p>
