# 🍂 My Favorite Recipe – Autumn’s Bounty  

This project is a redesigned recipe page for **[Autumn’s Bounty](https://www.level1chef.com/stardew-valley-autumns-bounty/)**, a classic dish from *Stardew Valley*. I wanted to give this cozy in-game food a fresh look with a clean layout, warm visuals, and playful details that feel true to the spirit of the game.

The recipe comes from **[Bryan](https://www.level1chef.com/about/)**, the creator of the blog **[Level 1 Chef](https://www.level1chef.com/)**. He combines culinary training with a love for video games, turning “fiction foods” into real dishes that are approachable and fun.

My redesign focuses on capturing the *Stardew Valley* vibe—calm, welcoming, and just a little magical—so that anyone visiting the page feels like they’ve discovered this recipe straight out of the game.
